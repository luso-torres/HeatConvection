# Heat Convection Through Cylindrical Tubes

This project aimed to numerically evaluate heat transfer in crossflow over a series of circular tubes arranged in rows. 

The analysis utilized the transient Control Volume Finite Element Method (CVFEM) in MATLAB.

Additionally, the project includes mesh characterization and an assessment of associated errors with the technique.

A video demonstrating the technique is available at: [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/)]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE](https://youtu.be/4YCkdnhKCBk?si=rTOc3xx30IJgp-dx))
